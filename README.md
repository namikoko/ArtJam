## Description
I made this project kind of tying it to another project I am working on, I have taken CART 253 before and I wish I had the knowledge I have now back then. Anyways, this projects represents to me what it felt like to be in ''The Abyss'' which is a part of my life when I struggled a lot, I wanted to add interactivity for the user and the black out part is to show in a way that struggle is not linear, and sometimes even when there is a lot of pain, we can become numb to all the stimulus and problems coming at us, so yeah this is my project Echoes of the abyss ! :)

### Controls:
- **mouseX**: Controls the noise scale, which can make the lines thinner, thicker or just black out the whole page.
- **mouseY**: Controls the spacing between lines, affecting how dense or spread out the abstract shapes are.
- **mouse press**: Clicking on the canvas temporarily adjusts the line spacing, allowing for even more interaction.
